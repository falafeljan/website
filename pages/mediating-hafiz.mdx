  title: 'Mediating Hafiz',

‘Mediating Hafiz’ is a research project that emerged from a student project at one of [Gregory Crane's](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/gregoryCrane) labs at Leipzig University's Digital Humanities chair. The project [made it to a short paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3343667) that recently got presented at [HT'09](https://human.iisys.de/ht2019/).

The paper discussed preliminary work conducted by [Maryam Foradi](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/team/), [Johannes Pein](https://twitter.com/codeislego), Gregory Crane, and myself in early 2019. We tackled the issue of disambiguation when attempting to translate words from the Persian language Farsi to, e.g., English: in Farsi, the three short vowels _a_, _e_, and _o_, aren't commonly written.

This bears issues for language learners: To properly translate and pronounce a word, you need contextual knowledge on which meaning it actually conveys. The Arabic language shares this ambiguity. For example, the arabic word “<span className={styles.farsi}>حمص</span>” translates to both the dish [hummus](https://thetakeout.com/ive-been-pronouncing-hummus-wrong-and-none-of-you-told-1826484597) as well as the city of [Homs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs).

We attempt at incorporating IPA transliterations, crowdsourcing, and aligned spoken Farsi to achieve two particular goals: _First,_ making language learners gaining language skills. _Second,_ gathering training data for computational transliteration methods. The preliminary results we discussed hint at possibilities for learning effects which we want to study in the future.
