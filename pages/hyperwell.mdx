The Master's thesis I conduct at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/) in 2019 concerns the general idea of establishing peer-to-peer (P2P) workflows in Digital Humanities (DH) research. **Data validity, automatic versioning, enhanced privacy, and facilitated collaboration** are just several prospects of well-designed P2P networks ([Kleppmann, 2019](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2019/10/23/local-first-at-onward.html))---all of which can be favourable for the Digital Humanities: A young, fast-paced, and inherently digital field ([Hunyadi, 2016](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315572659/chapters/10.4324/9781315572659-10)).

In particular, the P2P distribution of [W3C Linked Data Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) is considered, which could benefit popular DH infrastructure such as [IIIF image resources](https://iiif.io/) and [textual annotations with Recogito](https://recogito.pelagios.org/). The Dat Foundation offers a flexible hypermedia protocol ([Robinson et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018221.pdf)), built upon [hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore), a distributed append-only log ([Ogden et al., 2017](https://github.com/datprotocol/whitepaper/blob/master/dat-paper.pdf)), which will be utilized to built a preliminary prototype implementation.

To evaluate the prospects of emerging P2P workflows, we will conduct user studies and interviews with scholars in the Digital Humanities field.
