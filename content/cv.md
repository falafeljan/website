With years of practical experience, my work resides at the intersection between technology, arts, and culture. I stem my practice from academic research, interdisciplinary design processes, and cutting-edge full-stack software engineering.

Currently, I work as a software engineer at [Neighbourhoodie](https://neighbourhood.ie/), a software consulting agency that specialises in offline-capable applications and the [Apache CouchDB database](https://couchdb.apache.org/).

As a research assistant on the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/en/)-funded project [“Digital Critical Edition of the Nyāyabhāsya”](https://www.gko.uni-leipzig.de/indologie-zaw/forschungprojekte/aktuelle-projekte/projekt-digitale-kritische-edition.html) at Universität Leipzig, I maintained software for managing and publishing digital critical editions of Sanskrit works.

I hold a Master’s degree in computer science from [Universität Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/). In [my Master's thesis](/hyperwell) I conducted research on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems and workflows for academic annotation in Digital Humanities and presented a system called [hyperwell](https://hyperwell.org/). Furthermore, with the [‘Mediating Hafiz’ project](/mediating-hafiz), we applied citizen science research practices to Farsi language learning and computational transliteration. These works [have been published and presented](/publications) at academic conferences such as the [ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3342220.3343667).

Prior to that, I’ve interned at [Colony](https://colony.io/), where I integrated distributed systems with Ethereum smart contracts, as well as at [Miele](https://www.miele.de/), where I researched artificial intelligence applications in the context of smart homes. Together with the Cologne-based techno label [Kompakt](https://kompakt.fm/) and [ununu](https://ununu.io/), we explored the potential of blockchain technology and decentralised collaboration workflows in the music industry. From 2016-2018, I collaborated with [designmetropole aachen](https://www.designmetropole-aachen.de/) on the award-winning [hello designer tour](https://hellodesignertour.eu/).

I did my undergrad at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). In [my Bachelor's thesis](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/kassel) at the [Media Computing Group](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/), I focused on human-computer interaction and explored the technical feasibility of tourist experiences in virtual reality (VR).

My current interests reside in distributed systems that ensure privacy and data ownership alongside considerations on usability. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
