I currently pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/), Germany, where I'm conducting research on peer-to-peer data workflows for fellow scholars as part of [my Master's thesis](/hyperwell). Furthermore, with [‘Mediating Hafiz’](/mediating-hafiz), we attempt to apply Citizen Science to Farsi language learning and computational transliteration.

Prior to that, I’ve been an intern at [Colony](https://colony.io/), working on integrating distributed systems with Ethereum smart contracts, as well as at [Miele](https://www.miele.de/), researching about Artificial Intelligence applications in the Smart Home context.

I did my undergrad at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/), where I focused on human-computer interaction during [my Bachelor's thesis](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/kassel) at the [Media Computing Group](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/).

My interest lies in distributed systems that ensure privacy, usability, and autonomy in environments such as arts, society, and academic research. If you want to collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out!
