As a research assistant on the DFG-funded project [“Digital Critical Edition of the Nyāyabhāsya”](https://www.gko.uni-leipzig.de/indologie-zaw/forschungprojekte/aktuelle-projekte/projekt-digitale-kritische-edition.html) at Universität Leipzig, I develop software for creating and publishing digital critical editions of Sanskrit works.

Previously, I have finished a Master’s degree in Computer Science at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/), Germany. In [my Master's thesis](/hyperwell) I conducted research on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems and workflows for academic annotation in Digital Humanities and presented a system called [hyperwell](https://hyperwell.org/). Furthermore, with the [‘Mediating Hafiz’ project](/mediating-hafiz), we attempted to apply Citizen Science to Farsi language learning and computational transliteration.

Prior to that, I’ve interned at [Colony](https://colony.io/), where I integrated distributed systems with Ethereum smart contracts, as well as at [Miele](https://www.miele.de/), where I researched Artificial Intelligence applications in the Smart Home context.

I did my undergrad at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/). In [my Bachelor's thesis](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/kassel) at the [Media Computing Group](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/), I focused on human-computer interaction and explored the technical feasibility of tourist experiences in virtual reality (VR).

My interests reside in distributed systems that ensure privacy, usability, and autonomy in environments such as arts, society, and academic research. Please don't hesitate to reach out!
