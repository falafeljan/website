      I currently pursue my master’s degree in Computer Science at Leipzig
      University, Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to that, I’ve been an intern at Miele, researching about
      Artificial Intelligence and Smart Home, and at RWTH Aachen University,
      where I focused on human-computer interaction during my bachelor
      studies.

      My interest lies in digital applications that affect arts, society, and
      research. I search for artistic simplicity in complex systems and pursue
      to empower the individual.

      I’m currently available for research projects as independent contractor.
